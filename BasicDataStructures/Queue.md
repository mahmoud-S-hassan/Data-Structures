# Queue

A queue is a collection of elements with two main operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the collection, and dequeue, which removes the oldest element.

## Overview

Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first to be removed. They are often used in scenarios where the order of processing elements matters, such as task scheduling or managing data in a breadth-first search algorithm.
